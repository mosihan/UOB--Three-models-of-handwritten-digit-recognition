# UOB--Three-models-of-handwritten-digit-recognition
MORSE dissertation-related code, ID number: 2230042

## Explanation of the first.ipynb
Results of the initial training of the three models

## Explanation of the LR_curve.ipynb、SVM_curve.ipynb、NN_curve.ipynb
Plot learning curve of logistic regression(LR), support vector machine(SVM), neural network(NN) model to determine the direction of hyperparameter tuning

## Explanation of the LR_CV.ipynb、SVM_CV.ipynb、NN_CV.ipynb
Results of logistic regression(LR), support vector machine(SVM), neural network(NN) model cross-validation and grid search

## Explanation of the last.ipynb
Training results of the three models after hyperparameter tuning

## Other notes
Due to the slow training speed of Colab, some of the code was trained on my laptop's spider software. All final results are based on the dissertation.
